What was my motivation - Coding is something I've loved ever since I've came across it in high school. No matter what
job I had or who I was with I always found my mind going back to Javascript. I began this Bootcamp because I want to
learn more about this world of coding and see if I got what it takes to become a fulltime developer.

Why did I build this project - I built this project because I believe it is a stepping stone on the pathway to becoming
a fulltime developer. I believe each of these stepping stones contain a piece of a skill or hold a bit of knowledge. If I walk this path long enough then I'll eventaully be able to carve out my own coding path or help someone create theirs.

What problem does this project solve - This project helped me get some experience in what it will be like to work as a developer. I got to see how a ticket may present itself in the workforce and I got to come up with strategies on how I would deal with said ticket.

What did I learn - I learned the value in DRY, comments, and properly sectioning code. How following proper structure makes code easier to read which makes bugs easier to spot and deal with.

What makes this project stand out - This project stands out because it looks like a perfectly functional website. It wasn't until I interacted with the links that I noticed something was up.
